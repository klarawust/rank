# RANK - a game for you and your friends

I learned this game a couple of years ago, and I have played it uncountable times since. It fits in every social occasion, with all kinds of different people. Normally I use a set of cards, but now I am creating this digital version for the times where there are no playing-cards available. I hope you will enjoy the game and share it with your friends as well!
